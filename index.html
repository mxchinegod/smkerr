                <p class="card-text">The personalised and empowering experience of a home birth can also occur in a
                  hospital setting. While you can't really have a home birth inside a hospital, you don't have to give
                  up your
                  power, even if you need interventions to guide you through a successful birth. This book presents 15
                  powerful
                  testimonies about this kind of emotionally satisfying birth. The stories show that expectant mothers
                  can minimize fear and put technology where it belongs.

              <p class="mb-0">"Stacey Kerr is my kind of woman (and writer). Sharp, dedicated enough to become a doctor
                and wild enough to saddle up a Harley Davidson and lean into the turns in her search for freedom. The
                book’s a delight, and made me wish I knew her personally. As a man who built and rode motorcycles until
                I was 78 I share her affection for them. I’m delighted to recommend this book, especially to women who
                may be pondering what their search for freedom and service might become.”</p>

              <p class="mb-0">"I read and rode along with Dr. Kerr in Wild Heart, and loved the ride! I loved that she
                named her motorcycles; the emotional connection to her wheels came through strong and clear, along with
                her beautiful writing – a winning combination that pulled me right along with her. I loved that she grew
                and gained confidence, realizing that she always had that power within but it just needed to come out.
                I could totally relate to “wanting fun without filters” and to “when I rode I forgot about being fragile
                - I felt strong and capable and brave.”
                No one starts out as an expert rider, and Dr. Kerr wasn’t afraid to admit she was scared. Stepping out
                of our comfort zones and doing things that are scary are where we gain the most personal growth and
                confidence. Stacey really did that and I felt like I was riding with her, cheering her on!
                I had so much fun reading this advance copy that I went back and read it twice! Such an inspiring read
                for anyone! I think books like this can make a difference, illustrating that anything is possible if you
                put your mind to it and open your heart. I can’t help but feel proud of her!"</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Dr. Stacey Kerr’s Wild Heart is a call to adventure, friendship and self-forgiveness for
                women who, like me, have clocked a few miles on the old odometer, but are still looking for answers to
                life’s toughest questions.
                With echoes of Wild and Eat, Pray, Love; Wild Heart also follows an independent woman traveling on the
                road to enlightenment, but Kerr embraces her journey her own way, on a Harley accompanied by her two
                motorcycle-riding, soul-sisters.
                As an innate outsider herself, Kerr speaks directly to those of us who have always felt a little
                different, but still long for connection with others. As she sets out in search of finding the formula
                for true intimacy her keen observations and examinations of friendship between women expose her
                scientific-mind, her childlike-curiosity and her profound need to belong.
                Kerr’s life is riveting. Her reflections from living on a bohemian commune to becoming a distinguished
                doctor later in life made my inner-hippie ‘ohm’ with envy, and my outer feminist scream with delight!
                Kerr bravely bares her soul throughout her memoir, sharing gut-wrenching moments of personal,
                professional and parental failure; but as the pages turn she lifts your spirit as you watch her rise
                from the dust her bike leaves behind.
                Wild Heart is a true testament to the resilience of the human spirit. While others will try to tame us,
                Kerr urges us to stay wild, and embrace life in all of its bittersweet complexities. However old you
                are, however bumpy the road gets, Kerr reminds us to keep on riding and to always “make it the best you
                can.”
